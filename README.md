## Project Overview
  
As a biological researcher, Roza's role was to discover and document these bacteria.  She is interested in bacterial species that can synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Her lab partnered up with Improbable Beef, a food startup to research candidate species.  Labs around the country have had success in synthesizing meat from algae, fungi, and microorganisms found on plants, unlike Improbable Beef.  It is still searching for the elusive bacteria that will provide the perfect taste.  Roza's hypothesis that there is a microorganism that can supply the next best taste of beef.  She believes the bacteria can be found on the human body ideally found in the belly button.   She has sampled the navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species in the belly button. Roza wants a dashboard that the research participants and researchers can access.  Participants need to be able to visit a website and select their ID number to see which bacterial species live their belly button.

## Challenge Overview

The goals of this challenge:

1. Create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel. Use JavaScript to select only the most populous species.
2. Create a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s navel.
3. Complete the demographic information panel, if you have not done so.
